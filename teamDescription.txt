Our team consists of 4 people with basic coding knowledge and 1 member with good background knowledge with java graphics. Our goal was to create a graphics GUI in java as a base for our application, and to create the application base, user base, and app request base usuing text files and a java file reader. We wanted to learn how to create a GUI that had lasting changes applied to it, as well as how to function as a team on a project.  
In our project, you can see our background coming to use in the GUI and java file readers.  This feature was extremely important to getting this project off the ground.  Also, one of our testers also brought in knowlegde of javadoc comments.  They brought in better organization to our project, including a summary page containing all the classes and javadoc files.  This feature helped us all be able to read through the code better and figure out how to properly test it.
