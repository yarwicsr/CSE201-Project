Our team consists of four people with basic coding knowledge and one member with good background knowledge with Java Graphics. Our goal was to create a graphics GUI in java as a base for our application, and to create the application base, user base, and app request base using text files and a java file reader. We wanted to learn how to create a GUI that had lasting changes applied to it, as well as how to function as a team on a project.  
In our project, you can see our background coming to use in the GUI and java file readers.  This feature was extremely important to getting this project off the ground.  Also, one of our testers also brought in knowledge of javadoc comments.  They brought in better organization to our project, including a summary page containing all the classes and javadoc files.  This feature helped us all be able to read through the code better and figure out how to properly test it. 
Another goal of the project was to figure out how testing and test driven development worked.  We ended up successfully testing our project using unit tests, as well as creating black box, white box and gray box tests that helped us streamline our project as we finished it up.  The results of these tests showed us new bugs that we were able to fix. 
Overall, we were able to create a program mostly to our liking and deliver the requirements to our client in a way that they were satisfied with.
